          ones. <br />
          ALGO DIAMOND will fuel transactions in the crypto-ecosystem,
          redefining the existing features of current De-Fi. <br />
          <br />
          <br />

          Owning ALGO DIAMOND truly guarantees you slots on our launchpad, we
          are not implementing lottery system like other launchpads.

            Launchpad is a new technique that ushered in a new form of
            fundraising for 
            blockchain and cryptocurrency projects popularly known as IDO

            These are supposed to allow just and even distribution of tokens to
            early 
            investors. Sadly, the current launchpads have been overly rigged
            against 
            the platform supporters, hence, creating fertile ground for
            corruption. The 
            system is rig of bot buyers, confusing token sales instruction, and
            
            centralization gives an unfair advantage to the whale who rob other
            active 
            community participants of the privilege of having ownership of the
            new 
            project on the launchpad.
